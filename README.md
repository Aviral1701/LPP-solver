# LPP Solver

I created this for an assignment of Course MAN-010.It solves the LPP(Linear Programming Problem) in two variables using the graphical method.

It uses the graphics.h library of C to create graphics.It supports constraints of "less than equal to" type only.And gives the maximum value of the objective function and also highlights the feasible region!

## How to run?
+ Go through this [blog](http://www.codingalpha.com/install-run-graphics-h-ubuntu) to install graphics.h.
+ Run this command `g++ main.cpp -o YO -lgraph`.
+ And `./Yo`

## How to give Input?
+ Input the coefficents of objective function.
+ Input the number of constraints.
+ Input the coefficents of constraints.
